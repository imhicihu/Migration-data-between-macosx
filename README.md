# RATIONALE #

* This repo is -mainly for internal use-, but it can be useful for those who need to migrate data in the most *resilient*, *efficient* way. 
* This repository just hold our datums gathered, checklist _et alia_ and begin and end if fulfill our needs. Anyway, *one caveat*: "There is no responsability for data loss".
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time.
